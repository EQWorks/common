# Meetings

Use the guides below as a starting point, and adapt for specific situations accordingly.

## Before A Meeting

Objectives:
- Give all participants as much context as possible before the meeting.
- _Asynchronously_ resolve as many items as possible before the meeting.
- Determine, and possibly _reduce_, the scope, and length of the meeting.
- Determine, and possibly _eliminate_, reasons to participate in the meeting.
- Prepare the meeting set up to be as convenient as possible for all participants.
- Crowdsource bookkeeping effort to increase accuracy, and minimize bias.

Guide:
- Preferably 1 work-day before the meeting, initiate one discussion per agenda item.
    - The discussion can be a Slack thread, GitHub issue, Asana task, Google Docs, or anything with an interactive "comments" component.
    - For a recurring meeting with past sessions, use the ones from the previous meeting session as a starting point. Remove ones no longer needed.
    - For a net-new meeting, the organizer(s) should define the initial scope of items.
    - Optionally initiate an extra, open-ended discussion to collect additional topics from all participants, graduate solidified ones to have their discussions.
- In each discussion, participants write down briefing, information, knowledge, and ideas that are relevant.
    - For a recurring meeting with past sessions, focus on briefings of pending items from the previous meeting session, such as what each _has done_, _has been doing_, and _plans to do_. Give everyone else a sense of _where you are_ and _the direction you're heading to_. This helps others to determine if there are potential directional conflicts/blocks.
    - Raise relevant questions, problems, obstacles, unknowns, and any other issues. Try to make them demonstratable, by leveraging modern tools such as screen-captured images or videos, and/or steps to reproduce these issues.
    - Preemptively discuss. Seek to resolve as many issues and directional conflicts/blocks as possible.
- Cross off resolved (or portions of) items from the list of the meeting agenda. In the event of having all the item discussions resolved, skip to [section: After A Meeting](#after-a-meeting).
- Put a tentative timebox on each unresolved item. This can be an outcome of a collective agreement.
- Send a calendar invite to all participants, with Zoom/Hangouts Meet.

## During A Meeting

Objectives:
- Maximize the gain of synchronous/in-person/voice communication to resolve items.
- Record as many details as possible for future context.
- Crowdsource bookkeeping effort to increase accuracy, and minimize bias.
- Control time usage.

Guide:
- Demonstrate issues, instead of just abstractly talking about them.
- Aggressively control the timebox of each item. If the item is resolved sooner than the tentative timebox, skip ahead promptly, leave the jokes and fun talks for some other time.
- If certain items cannot be resolved within the timebox, record all reasons and context into the per-item discussion formed in [section: Before A Meeting](#before-a-meeting) and move on.
- Proactively record notes in the per-item discussion formed in [section: Before A Meeting](#before-a-meeting).

## After A Meeting

Objectives:
- Have clear takeaways.
- Organize meeting notes to be as comprehensive as possible, for both non-participants and future self.
- Determine suitable follow-ups for leftovers.

Guide:
- Amend per-item discussion with afterthoughts.
- Summarize and derive actionable from the per-item discussion, place them within the per-item discussion
    - It may be a good idea to use a more distinguishable section for the summaries and actionable, highly dependent on what tool is used for the discussions (WIP: need suggestions).
- Attempt to resolve leftovers in per-item discussion asynchronously.
- If the scope of the leftover is too complex, set a time for a follow-up meeting.
- Preserve per-item discussion as meeting notes for future reference.
