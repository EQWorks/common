# Common Guidelines

# Communications

## General guidelines

Communication is critical in any organization. We want to ensure that we are considerate of other people's production processes and time.

Effective communication should achieve the purpose of unblocking others and mitigate potential blocks from others. The focus should be on actual problem solving and creative endeavours instead of drowning oneself in methods and tools when communicating.

## Tools

We use an evolving set of tools to facilitate communication. Notably, we use **Slack**, **GitHub,** **Google Workspace**, **Hugo**, Discord, Notion, and Asana. The ones in **bold text** are today's staple tools that cover the majority of the team members.

We also actively look for opportunities to automate workflows and eliminate or minimize tedious and error-prone processes by integrating tools primarily channelled into the most adopted platform, **Slack**.

**In principle:** We adopt, utilize, and adapt tools and workflows to be productive. Learn the tools, make the tools serve us. Do not drown in them and sacrifice actual productivity.

## Asynchronous and Transparent Communication by Default

Whenever you want to communicate with others, default to an asynchronous way (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Notion). By doing so, you respect others' time and productivity and the fact that they may not want to be interrupted. Use Slack channels/threads, GitHub projects/issues, Notion pages, Asana tasks, or emails to coordinate with other team members asynchronously.

At the same time, adopt more transparent ways to communicate. For example, on Slack, instead of direct messaging, utilize more channels and threads. This way, we retain these communications as a raw form of documentation and references that we can search, recollect, and share/reuse.

**In principle:** resort to **asynchronous** and **transparent** communications by default, unless:

- The communication is not related to work (e.g., your weekend trip. Although we encourage these joyful times to be shared for all too)
- The communication involves secrets (e.g., database credentials)

## Synchronous Communication when Needed

When it is more productive to conduct in a more synchronous manner of communication, such as meetings, be mindful and treat meetings as scarce resources to be treasured as they involve the collective productivity value of all its participants during the time of synchronous communication.

**In principle:** Engage in synchronous communications, such as meetings, when necessary. When meetings are needed, consult the [guides on meetings](./meetings.md) to make the most out of them.

## Tips

**Budget communication time:** Try to adopt a working schedule to initiate, check and respond to communications. To a certain extent, this means try to optimize for the whole block of contiguous time that suits you better for your job and your working style.

**Minimize distractions:** It's hard to keep up with all fronts of these communication tools. Instead, take time to learn how to configure them to suit your needs and working style. We have a few [example mechanisms](./slack.md) to help with the overwhelming feeling of too many notifications and aid in persisting and making accessible, valuable company information.
