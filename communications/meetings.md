# Meetings

Use the guides below as a starting point, and adapt for specific situations accordingly.

## Before A Meeting

Objectives:
- Determine the scope and minimum length of the meeting.
- Give all participants as much context as possible to make an informed decision on RSVP.
- Gather topics and issues for agenda items that are relevant to the scope of the meeting,
done either individually or through crowdsourcing to increase accuracy and minimize bias
- Asynchronously resolve as many agenda items as possible before the meeting.

Guide:
- Send a calendar invite to all participants, with Zoom/Hangouts Meet.
- Create a meeting agenda on Hugo, provide sufficient time for participants to read through ahead of the meeting.
- Create a meeting note on Hugo for discussion on meeting agenda, sync it to Slack to augment this experience.
    - On Hugo or Slack, participants should write down briefing, information, knowledge, and ideas.
    - Participants should also raise questions, problems, obstacles, unknowns, and any other types of issues. Try to provide a demonstratable context to them.
    - Seek to resolve as many issues and directional conflicts as possible.
- Edit meeting agenda to reflect the outcomes of the discussion meeting note.
- Put a tentative timebox on each agenda item.

Tips:
- Turn off Hugo filter on "Hide meetings with notes" to fit the practice of having pre-meeting notes for discussions.

## During A Meeting

Objectives:
- Align & inform all participants of relevant information at the same time (synchronously)
- Maintain time for each agenda item & scope of meeting as intended
- Record as many details as possible for future context/meetings
- Crowdsource bookkeeping effort to increase accuracy, and minimize bias.

Guide:
- Create a new meeting note on Hugo for in-meeting recording and discussions, sync it to Slack to augment this experience.
- Briefly go over the agenda items and the timebox given for each item.
- Demonstrate issues, instead of abstractly talking about them.
- If certain items cannot be resolved within the timebox, record all reasons and context into the in-meeting note and move on.
- All participants to proactively reply to the in-meeting note to record as much context as possible.

## After A Meeting

Objectives:
- Organize meeting notes to be as comprehensive as possible, for both non-participants and future self.
- Determine suitable follow-ups for leftovers.
- Persist relevant information to a knowledge base.

Guide:
- Add to the in-meeting note with afterthoughts.
- Summarize and derive actionable items from both pre-meeting and in-meeting notes.
    - Optionally create GitHub issues, Asana tasks, etc., to fit the execution workflow of the relevant team.
- If the scope of the leftover is too complex, set a time for a follow-up meeting.
