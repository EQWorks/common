# Meetings

Use the guides below as a starting point, and adapt for specific situations accordingly.

## Before A Meeting

Objectives:

- Determine the scope and minimum length of the meeting.
- Give all participants as much context as possible to make an informed decision on RSVP.
- Gather topics and issues for agenda items that are relevant to scope of the meeting,
done either individually or through crowdsourcing to increase accuracy and minimize bias
- Asynchronously resolve as many agenda items as possible before the meeting.

Guide:

- Send a calendar invite to all participants, with Zoom/Hangouts Meet.
- Create the meeting agenda on Hugo for the meeting, provide sufficent time ahead of the meeting to accommodate all participants.
    - For a net-new meeting, the organizer(s) should define the initial scope of agenda items.
    - For a recurring meeting with past sessions, use the agenda/notes items from the previous meeting session as a starting point. Remove ones no longer needed or already resolved.
- Initiate one or more meeting note(s) on Hugo for meeting agenda discussions.
    - Send these notes to relevant Slack channel.
    - Edit meeting agenda to reflect the outcome of these discussions.
- In each meeting note, participants write down briefing, information, knowledge, and ideas that are relevant.
    - For a recurring meeting with past sessions, focus on briefings of pending items from the previous meeting session, such as what each _has done_, _has been doing_, and _plans to do_. Give everyone else a sense of _where you are_ and _the direction you're heading to_. This helps others to determine if there are potential directional conflicts/blocks.
    - Raise relevant questions, problems, obstacles, unknowns, and any other issues. Try to make them demonstratable, by leveraging modern tools such as screen-captured images or videos, and/or steps to reproduce these issues.
    - Preemptively discuss. Seek to resolve as many issues and directional conflicts/blocks as possible.
- Cross off resolved (or portions of) items from the list of the meeting agenda. In the event of having all the item discussions resolved, skip to [section: After A Meeting](#after-a-meeting).
- Put a tentative timebox on each unresolved item. This can be an outcome of a collective agreement.

Tips:

Turn off Hugo filter on "Hide meetings with notes" to fit the practice of having pre-meeting notes for discussions.

Since Hugo does a good job at syncing notes discussion as Slack threads, liberally participate on either platform.

## During A Meeting

Objectives:
- Align & inform all participants of relevant information at the same time (synchronously)
- Maintain time for each agenda item & scope of meeting as intended
- Record as many details as possible for future context/meetings
- Crowdsource bookkeeping effort to increase accuracy, and minimize bias.

Guide:
- Briefly go over the agenda items, and timebox given for each item.
- Demonstrate issues, instead of abstractly talking about them.
- If certain items cannot be resolved within the timebox, record all reasons and context into the notes formed in [section: Before A Meeting](#before-a-meeting) and move on.
- All participants to proactively reply to meeting notes formed in [section: Before A Meeting](#before-a-meeting) to record as much context as possible. Start new notes as needed, such as when there are topics distinct from the ones formed before.

## After A Meeting

Objectives:
- Organize meeting notes to be as comprehensive as possible, for both non-participants and future self.
- Determine suitable follow-ups for leftovers.
- Persist relevant information to a knowledge base.

Guide:
- Amend notes with afterthoughts.
- Summarize and derive actionable from the notes.
    - Start a new note on Hugo under the meeting for this if needed.
- Attempt to resolve leftovers in each note asynchronously.
- If the scope of the leftover is too complex, set a time for a follow-up meeting.
