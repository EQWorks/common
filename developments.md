# Development

### [üñ•Ô∏è &nbsp;git](git.md)

We primarily adopt the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). We emphasize the importance of clean commit history, good commit message conventions, and the tools/automation to take advantage of them.

We also discuss good branching and peer review practices, with guides and tips to collaborating with others (including future-selves).

### [üî† &nbsp;naming](naming.md)

Naming conventions for codebases to help us minimize confusion and mitigate issues when there is a lack of documentation.
