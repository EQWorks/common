# Common

Our evolving handbook, based on common philosophies and practices, to groom good work culture and environment.

For new or prospective members, this handbook is for you to understand how to be a part of the organization, contribute productively, grow, and enjoy.

For existing members, this handbook is for you to refer, re-examine, and suggest revisions to morph it into a better shape that suits the ever-evolving meta and dynamics.

We actively absorb and adapt valuable bits and pieces from [references by other individuals and organizations](references.md).

## General

### [üîç &nbsp;Hiring](hiring.md)

In [this section](hiring.md), we discuss our hiring principles and supporting methods.

### [üìù &nbsp;Communications](communications/README.md)

In [this section](communications/README.md), we discuss our principle of by default being asynchronous and transparent communications while embracing the necessity of synchronous communications and providing [supporting guidelines](communications/meetings.md) to make them more efficient.

We also have guides on [Slack](communications/slack.md), [GitHub projects](communications/github-projects.md), and [journaling](communications/journal.md) that embrace the core principle of effective communications in asynchronous and transparent manners.

### [ü§ñ &nbsp;Workspace Automation](workspace-automation.md)

The various automation tools and workflows we build to sustain and synergize with our conventions and principles.

## Technical

### [üñ•Ô∏è &nbsp;git](git.md)

We primarily adopt the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). We emphasize the importance of clean commit history, good commit message conventions, and the tools/automation to take advantage of them.

We also discuss good branching and peer review practices, with guides and tips to collaborating with others (including future-selves).

### [üî† &nbsp;naming](naming.md)

Naming conventions for codebases to help us minimize confusion and mitigate issues when there is a lack of documentation.
