# EQ Engineering

Our living handbook is based on common philosophies and practices to create a positive work culture and environment.

For new or prospective members, this handbook is for you to understand how to be a part of the organization, contribute productively, grow, and enjoy.

For existing members, this handbook is for you to refer, re-examine, and suggest revisions to morph it into a better shape that suits the ever-evolving meta and dynamics.
