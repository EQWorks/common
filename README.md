# Common

Our living handbook is based on common philosophies and practices to create a positive work culture and environment.

For new or prospective members, this handbook is for you to understand how to be a part of the organization, contribute productively, grow, and enjoy.

For existing members, this handbook is for you to refer, re-examine, and suggest revisions to morph it into a better shape that suits the ever-evolving meta and dynamics.

We actively absorb and adopt valuable bits and pieces from [references by other individuals and organizations](references.md).

## General

### [ü§î &nbsp;Decision-making](decision-making.md)

[This section](decision-making.md) introduces our principles for decision-making, which serve as the foundation for our work culture.

We encourage decision-making in a round-table manner through grassroots meritocracy.

In turn, this promotes a culture of open-mindedness, helps us adapt to the changing world, and sustains longevity to our members and the organization.

### [ü™ê &nbsp;Structure](structure.md)

Our [organization structure](structure.md) derives from the open-source community and practices, which bears the characteristics of being flat, fluid, and distributed.

The structure is a natural fit for making decisions and maximizing our collective value, happiness, productivity, and innovation. Matters irrelevant to accomplishing objectives such as "where one must be to work" are not a concern (one should work where they prefer to be.)

### [üîç &nbsp;Hiring](hiring.md)

In [this section](hiring.md), we discuss our hiring principles and supporting methods.

### [üìù &nbsp;Communications](communications/README.md)

[This section](communications/README.md) focuses on the principle of prioritizing asynchronous and transparent communications while embracing the necessity of synchronous communications and providing [supporting guidelines](communications/meetings.md) to make them more efficient.

We also have guides on [Slack](communications/slack.md), [GitHub projects](communications/github-projects.md), and [journaling](communications/journal.md) based on the core principle of effective communications in asynchronous and transparent manners.

### [ü§ñ &nbsp;Automation](automation.md)

The various automation tools and workflows we build to sustain and synergize with our conventions and principles.

## Technical

### [üñ•Ô∏è &nbsp;git](git.md)

We primarily adopt the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). We emphasize the importance of clean commit history, good commit message conventions, and the tools/automation to take advantage of them.

We also discuss good branching and peer review practices, with guides and tips to collaborating with others (including future-selves).

### [üî† &nbsp;naming](naming.md)

Naming conventions for codebases to help us minimize confusion and mitigate issues when there is a lack of documentation.
