# Workspace Automation

Over time, we've established various workspace automation to boost our productivity and easily access the information we are interested in.

## Slack Slash Commands

Our slash commands automation is driven by [legion](https://github.com/eqworks/legion), our group chatbot.

### `/avail` - Checks who is where

This command complements our `Dev Avail` Asana project. In this project, each team member specifies their availability status, with optional details. This allows us to check each others' availability status without interruption.

### `/bday`
This command has 3 variants:
* `/bday sign` - sends a bday card link company wide, excluding the bday person, as a slack direct message. To be used in the `#general` channel
* `/bday send` - sends the bday card to the bday person as a direct message in slack
* `/bday celebrate` - triggers a bday message for the bday person. To be used in the `#general` channel
