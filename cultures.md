# Culture

We actively absorb and adopt valuable bits and pieces from [references by other individuals and organizations](references.md).

### [ü§î &nbsp;Decision-making](decision-making)

[This section](decision-making) introduces our principles for decision-making, which serve as the foundation for our work culture.

We encourage decision-making in a round-table manner through meritocracy.

In turn, this promotes a culture of open-mindedness, helps us adapt to the changing world, and sustains longevity to our members and the organization.

### [ü™ê &nbsp;Structure](structure.md)

Our [organization structure](structure.md) derives from the open-source community and practices, characterized by being flat, fluid, and distributed.

The structure is a natural fit for making decisions and maximizing our collective value, happiness, productivity, and innovation. Where you live and where you call home for life or just for the moment is your personal preference and part of what makes you a happy, contributing member of the team and is of little concern to us.

### [üìù &nbsp;Communications](communications/README.md)

[This section](communications/README.md) focuses on the principle of prioritizing asynchronous and transparent communications while embracing the necessity of synchronous communications and providing [supporting guidelines](communications/meetings.md) to make them more efficient.

We also have guides on [Slack](communications/slack.md), [GitHub projects](communications/github-projects.md), and [journaling](communications/journal.md) based on the core principle of effective communications in asynchronous and transparent manners.

### [ü§ñ &nbsp;Automation](automation.md)

The various automation tools and workflows we build to sustain and synergize with our conventions and principles.
