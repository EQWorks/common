# Common

Our living handbook is based on common philosophies and practices to create a positive work culture and environment.

For new or prospective members, this handbook is for you to understand how to be a part of the organization, contribute productively, grow, and enjoy.

For existing members, this handbook is for you to refer, re-examine, and suggest revisions to morph it into a better shape that suits the ever-evolving meta and dynamics.

We actively absorb and adopt valuable bits and pieces from [references by other individuals and organizations](_cultures/references.md).

## General

### [ü§î &nbsp;Decision-making](_cultures/decision-making.md)

[This section](_cultures/decision-making.md) introduces our principles for decision-making, which serve as the foundation for our work culture.

We encourage decision-making in a round-table manner through meritocracy.

In turn, this promotes a culture of open-mindedness, helps us adapt to the changing world, and sustains longevity to our members and the organization.

### [ü™ê &nbsp;Structure](_cultures/structure.md)

Our [organization structure](_cultures/structure.md) derives from the open-source community and practices, characterized by being flat, fluid, and distributed.

The structure is a natural fit for making decisions and maximizing our collective value, happiness, productivity, and innovation. Where you live and where you call home for life or just for the moment is your personal preference and part of what makes you a happy, contributing member of the team and is of little concern to us.

### [üîç &nbsp;Hiring](hiring.md)

In [this section](hiring.md), we discuss our hiring principles and supporting methods.

### [üìù &nbsp;Communications](_cultures/communication.md)

[This section](_cultures/communication.md) focuses on the principle of prioritizing asynchronous and transparent communications while embracing the necessity of synchronous communications and providing [supporting guidelines](_cultures/communication/meetings.md) to make them more efficient.

We also have guides on [Slack](_cultures/communication/slack.md), [GitHub projects](_cultures/communication/github-projects.md), and [journaling](_cultures/communication/journal.md) based on the core principle of effective communications in asynchronous and transparent manners.

### [ü§ñ &nbsp;Automation](_cultures/automation.md)

The various automation tools and workflows we build to sustain and synergize with our conventions and principles.

## Technical

### [üñ•Ô∏è &nbsp;git](_developments/git.md)

We primarily adopt the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). We emphasize the importance of clean commit history, good commit message conventions, and the tools/automation to take advantage of them.

We also discuss good branching and peer review practices, with guides and tips to collaborating with others (including future-selves).

### [üî† &nbsp;naming](_developments/naming.md)

Naming conventions for codebases to help us minimize confusion and mitigate issues when there is a lack of documentation.
